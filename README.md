## Source Control

    Always set up source control first.  

## Creating a computer vision model

### Step 1 - Set up the project
    structure is important for later steps where the ml framework will infer classes from directory structure

### Step 2 - Get some data
    https://www.ffmpeg.org/

### Step 3 - Generate training data
    https://keras.io/

### Step 4 - Create the model
